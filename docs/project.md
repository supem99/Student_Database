Description Of The Project

Vocational Training Authority is one of main educational institute in Colombo.
Branches of this institute are spread throughout every cities in Sri Lanka. Most
of the students who lives around these branches went to these institutes, for
getting goods which they want for getting vocational train in by various subject
streams. The main branch in Kalutara – North faced a huge problem in the
registration of new students and maintain the registered student details. In our
institute all the registration procedures are doing manually.

In that case the teachers and students face so many problems because of lack of
members to maintain student details. The teachers wrote all the registration
details and other daily details of the institute manually.

Once a day there were around 200 students coming to this institute. So the
teachers must check the register other than the finger print machine. That
procedure is not very easy. It is so difficult to enter all the details about daily
attendance and other procedures to the books manually.

To reduce these problems we think the most suitable solution is to prepare a
software for this procedure. So we’ll planned to made a new software for
reduce the problems which born from the transactions, registrations and the
daily process between the institute and the students.

Since year which the institute started it didn’t have any software or a system
to record their day to day procedure about registrations, attendance,
transactions and other works daily procedures,

* They use log books and record books for write their attendance and
other information about transactions and registrations.

* They have to use number of books to arrange their payments and log
notes. It wasted much money &amp; time.

* To maintain a large number of books and save them from harms is a
very big problem to this procedure.

* If these books will get lost or misplace, all the data will be get lost.

After referring the institute log books and collecting information from the
principal, We recognize the problems of the institute registration and daily
processing system between students .
So we decided to create useful software for this grocery to maintain their
accounts, registers and log details properly and easily.
we collect more information to create this software by helping the institute
teachers
Some of them are;
* which data they want to store and which functions they want to add to
the software.
* To avoid the accounting works delay, which is most efficient to get the
past details and how it should be do at the correct time and date.
* We discussed with them to add log details and finger print details daily
for this software to update.
